I am an Embedded Systems and IoT Engineer with a strong foundation in electronics, firmware development, and system-level integration, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication Engineering (2022–2026). My work focuses on designing reliable, scalable, and real-world embedded solutions that bridge hardware and software.

I have hands-on experience working with microcontrollers and embedded platforms including STM32, ESP32, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi, where I develop bare-metal and RTOS-based firmware using Embedded C and Python. My projects involve low-level peripheral interfacing (GPIO, ADC, PWM, UART, SPI, I²C), sensor integration, power management, and real-time data acquisition.

As a Project Intern at embedUR systems, I work on industry-grade embedded and IoT applications, gaining exposure to production-oriented development workflows, hardware–software co-design, and debugging of complex embedded systems. My internship experience has strengthened my understanding of robust firmware design, modular architecture, and real-world constraints such as latency, reliability, and resource optimization.

My project portfolio spans autonomous robotics, IoT-based monitoring systems, and AI-assisted embedded applications, including autonomous robots, smart infrastructure monitoring, fault detection systems, GPS-based tracking, and intelligent control systems. I have also implemented computer vision pipelines using OpenCV for tasks such as contour detection, depth estimation, object analysis, and vision-guided automation.

I am proficient in Linux-based embedded development, system-level debugging, and networking fundamentals. I regularly work with tools such as STM32CubeIDE, Arduino IDE, Git, KiCad, Fusion 360, MATLAB/Simulink, Wireshark, and Multisim, enabling me to move seamlessly from circuit design and PCB-level understanding to firmware and application development.

Beyond embedded hardware, I have developed software-driven systems using Python, Java, SQL, and TCP/IP, building end-to-end solutions that include dashboards, data logging, and communication interfaces. This allows me to design complete systems rather than isolated components.

I am deeply interested in embedded Linux, edge AI, robotics, and industrial IoT, with a long-term goal of working on high-impact embedded platforms and intelligent devices. I value clean architecture, documentation, and continuous learning, and I actively strengthen my skills through certifications, experimentation, and complex self-driven projects.
